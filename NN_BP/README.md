# Artificial Neural Network

This is an example of Feed-Forward Neural Network written in C. <br />
In this folder, the networks are first trained and then tested.

## Content

* nn_bp_iris.c - not trained neural network with iris dataset - english.
* nn_bp_xor.c - not trained neural network with XOR dataset - english.
* rede_neural_bp_iris.c - not trained neural network with iris dataset - portuguese.
* rede_neural_bp_xor.c - not trained neural network with XOR dataset - portuguese.

## What to expect

From iris dataset, it outputs the number of right classified samples from 45. <br />
From XOR dataset, the inputs are "0, 0; 0, 1; 1, 0; 1, 1" and the expected outputs are "0, 1, 1, 0".
