# Artificial Neural Network - Perceptron

This is an example of a perceptron written in C. <br />
In this folder, the networks are first trained and then tested.

## Content

* perceptron_iris.c - perceptron with iris dataset - petal length and petal width.
* perceptron_iris_full.c - perceptron with iris dataset - full dataset.
* perceptron_xor.c - perceptron with XOR.

The files with "_eng" are English and "_port" are Portuguese versions of the codes.


## What to expect

From iris dataset, it outputs the number of right classified samples from 45. <br />
From XOR dataset, the inputs are "0, 0; 0, 1; 1, 0; 1, 1" and the expected outputs are "0, 1, 1, 0".
