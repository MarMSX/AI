# Artificial Neural Network

This is an example of Feed-Forward Neural Network written in C. <br />
In this folder, the networks are all already trained. <br />
Use them to test different inputs.

## Content

* nn_iris.c - already trained neural network with iris dataset - english.
* nn_xor.c - already trained neural network with XOR dataset - english.
* rede_neural_iris.c - already trained neural network with iris dataset - portuguese.
* rede_neural_xor.c - already trained neural network with XOR dataset - portuguese.

## What to expect

From iris dataset, the input is "1.4, 0.2" and the expected output is "1, 0, 0" (class setosa). <br />
From XOR dataset, the input is "0, 1" and the expected output is "1". <br />
<br />
Change values on load_inputs() function for different inputs.
